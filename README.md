## Theme Directory

You can run certain theme commands, such as shoplazza theme serve, only if the directory you're using matches the default Shoplazza theme directory structure. This structure represents a buildless theme, or a theme that has already gone through any necessary file transformations. If you use build tools to generate theme files, then you might need to run commands from the directory where the generated files are stored.

The default Shoplazza theme directory structure is as follows:

```terminal
└── project
    ├── assets
    ├── config
    ├── layout
    ├── locales
    ├── sections
    ├── snippets
    └── templates
```
